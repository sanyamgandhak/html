            <h2 class="madecenter">Why we are on Mission ?</h2>
           <p class="thodaside ">According to Google poor nutrition and hunger is responsible for the death of 3.1 million children a year. That's nearly half of all deaths in children under the age of 5. 
            The children die because their bodies lack basic nutrients. Globally, 822 million people suffer 
            from undernourishment.So thats why we are on mission for decreasing death due to malnutrition.So we are on mission 
            for stoping deaths due to malnutrition in any part of the World as we believe everyone should have right to food irre
            spective of money and all the others things!!
        This website aims to provide food to each and everyone who needs it & we dont charge any cost for the same!!</p>

        <h2 class="downmore">Some Statistics</h2>
       <p class="thodaside">If we consider some stats regarding India then you will know that average food that get wasted in parties and 
           weddings is 20-25%.
           Around 100,000 weddings and social events are held in India every day. Food wasted each day at weddings and family functions in Mumbai alone would be enough to feed the cityâ€™s vast slum population.
            About 58 per cent of people in the country are food insecure, says the findings of the National Nutritional Survey (NNS) 2011. The country has enough food to feed its people but that poor cannot afford even two-square meals a day.
            About 21 million tonnes of wheat are wasted in India and 50% of all food across the world meets the same fate and never reaches the needy. In fact, according to the agriculture ministry, Rs. 50,000 crore worth of food produced is wasted every year in the country.

            This stats are about INDIA only but when we consider food wastage of all countries then it will lead to more bigger 
            number !!
